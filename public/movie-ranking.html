    <h1>The best movies I have watched so far</h1>
    <h2>My favorite movies of all time</h2>
    <hr> 

        <h3>
            Interstellar
        </h3>
            <p>Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. 
               Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. 
               Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. 
               That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. 
               I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. 
               I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. 
               This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. 
               So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant.
            </p>
        <h3>
            Spider-Man: No Way Home
        </h3>
            <p>
                Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. 
                The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. 
                The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. 
                This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. 
                Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!
            </p>
        <h3>
            The Shawshank Redemption
        </h3>
            <p>
                It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. 
                What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. 
                Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.
                The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.
                I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. 
                If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing.
