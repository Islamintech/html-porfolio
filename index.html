            <p>Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. 
               Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. 
               Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. 
               That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. 
               I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. 
               I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. 
               This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. 
               So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant.
